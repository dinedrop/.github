# .github Repository

This repository contains the community health files for our organization's projects on GitHub. These files help to ensure that our projects are welcoming, inclusive, and well-maintained, and provide guidance for contributors who are interested in getting involved.

## Community Health Files

The following files are included in this repository:

- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Guidelines for contributing to our projects, including how to report issues, suggest new features, and submit pull requests.

- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`: Our code of conduct for participants in our projects, which outlines the expectations for respectful and professional behavior.

- `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md`: A template for reporting issues in our projects, which includes instructions for how to provide the necessary information to help us identify and fix the problem.

- `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`: A template for submitting pull requests to our projects, which includes guidelines for how to write good code and provide clear explanations of the changes being made.

## GitHub Actions Workflows

In addition to our community health files, we also use this repository to store workflows for GitHub Actions. These automated processes help us to streamline our development and deployment processes, and can be triggered by events in our repositories, such as a pull request being opened or a new commit being pushed.

If you have any questions about our community health files or GitHub Actions workflows, please feel free to contact us at [contact@ourorganization.com](mailto:contact@ourorganization.com).
